# hello-world2
This is my second hello world git repository.

This is my first edit to the README file. 

Btw, I am following Git's tutorial [here] (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) and I am using the [markdown guide] (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) as a reference to format the text.
