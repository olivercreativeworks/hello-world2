# hello-world2
This is my second hello world git repository.

This is my first edit to the README file.

Also removing this to propmpt a merge conflict. Hehehe!

Replaced the previous sentence that was here to cause a merge conflict. Also for Science.


Btw, I am following Git's tutorial [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) and I am using the [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) as a reference to format the text.

I am testing rebase.
And possibly squash.
Another edit.


Yet another edit.
